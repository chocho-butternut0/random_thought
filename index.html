                <h1>A random thought.</h1>
                <p>Hello Isaiah,</p>
                
                <p>Uhm, I know you're busy. I was working out kanina, di ba? Sudden realization lang. I was wondering why sometimes I don’t feel your words deeply, even though I know what you're saying is genuine and true. I know it because I know you. I always understand you on a deeper level. I just don’t understand why I react that way.</p>

                <p>Sometimes when I read your messages, I just let them pass through my brain and then off they go. I don’t let them sink in, but I acknowledge them. And I figured it out, there’s still a part of me that doesn’t fully trust. I’m still scared that if I let myself feel everything and fall for it, one day you’ll be gone. Or you’ll try to get rid of me. Or you’ll stop being interested in me because I’ll be “too much.”</p>

                <p>I love deeply, Isaiah, and that’s what scares me. When I finally do, I’m scared you might change your mind. I know you wouldn’t, but it’s a thought I can’t seem to shake sometimes.</p>

                <p>I want to answer all of your questions carefully. What’s different with you? Because for the first time, I don't feel like running away. I don't feel like pulling away. Instead, I wanna run to you. You make me feel safe, understood, seen, secured, cared for, and loved in ways I didn’t even know were possible.</p>

                <p>I always think of myself as flawed. I feel like I would hurt people, like I eventually will. I make thousands of reasons to run away, to leave, to break free. I just don't wanna get hurt again.</p>

                <p>I learned to detach, to be numb, to be a bitch, literally. I built tall walls that even I couldn’t get out of. I avoid intimacy. I'm not craving it. I'm scared to be seen, to be known for who I truly am, because maybe, maybe I really am not deserving of love. I'm scared that maybe the more someone knows me, the less they’ll like me.</p>

                <p>And then there was you.</p>

                <p>You proved it all wrong. You proved me wrong. You lured me in, and now I'm six feet underground. I don’t wanna run away anymore, baby. I want to be with you. I’m not going anywhere but to you.</p>

                <p>When you said na if ayaw ko na, ayusin ko yung sabi sayo… that hurt me. Kasi bakit naman kita aayawan? My old ways are fucked, but I promise I won’t do that to you. Baby, you don’t deserve it, not even an ounce of hurtful words from anyone. Kengkoy lang ako minsan, pero I appreciate you a lot and I’m so thankful for your love.</p>

                <p>Parang tanga kasi ’to minsan. I don’t want to hurt you, pero pakagat kasi, nakakainis yun ah.</p>

                <p>Pero Isaiah… can you do that for me? Tell me if ayaw mo na sakin, ah. Para aware ako, at hindi ako manghuhula.</p>

                <p>Yours truly,<br>Arlette</p>
